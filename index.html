        This week we started to build our rube goldbeg machine and did a paper boat challenge
        the rube goldberg project has been a little troublesome as things didnt go according to plan.
        The paper boat challenge was a fil for my group due to havig to much weight on it.

 These pictures above show what we have been doing this past week. We did breadboarding on tinkercad last week but this week we did it in person.
 We had to use 3 different leds and then we used multi meters to see the resistence and voltage of the leds and how much power is going through the resistore.
