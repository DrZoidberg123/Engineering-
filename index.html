          Tinker cad was fun I even won a competition. We had to build a home appliance and I chose to build a couch

        This week we started to build our rube goldbeg machine and did a paper boat challenge
        the rube goldberg project has been a little troublesome as things didnt go according to plan.
        The paper boat challenge was a fil for my group due to havig to much weight on it.

 This week we have ben working on breadboarding. Its been tough to learn but satisfying to do.

 These pictures above show what we have been doing this past week. We did breadboarding on tinkercad last week but this week we did it in person.
 We had to use 3 different leds and then we used multi meters to see the resistence and voltage of the leds and how much power is going through the resistore.

This week we have been doing more breadboarding but more in depth. By in depth I mean that we learned how to tun the lights off and on in a pattern. Im glad my partner jason is good at beadboarding because Im not good at it.
For our challenge day we had to save a villages water because it was cancerous. Austin and I worked to together to build a big container/table to hold the water up then put a stove under it a boil it then cover it with plastic wrap to catch the drops which would not have bromide.

 This week we have been working on our final where we are placed in groups of four and we have to make a spaghetti bridge. We start with one hundred but we can only use twenty for the finale project.
 we started with the base thats what you see in the picture. We then will move on to do the top then reinforce it with the remaining noodles.

 This week and the weeks before break we worked on our spaghetti bridge and used many diffrent designs but our most simple design was the best in the whole class. We witheld the entire bucket of water. The weeks after the break we have been making a deal like shark tank with how much our product costs and all the expenses and details.

 This week we started learning about chemical engineering and what job titles they have. Mr Poole told us that we would be making oobleck a liquid when you slowly touch it but if you punch it or hit it with something it becomes solid.

 On tuesday we made oobleck which is what the image shows. It was a prett big mess but it was fun I guess.
 We started a big project for the third quarter of the school year where we have to make either a moustrap car, arduino car, or make a solution to a problem in the school.
 We have to first make a 6 page project proposal that is due monday then we have 6 weeks to make/plan out how we are gonna do it.
 
 This week we have been working on a 6 page proposal and also using our tinker cad to create the mousetrap car 
 
 <img src="BROOM.jpg" width="250px" height="200px"></img>
 WE DID IT. We made a car that is identical to our CAD but sadly it didnt work. We still made it though we tried our best. For one week I was absent so my partner austin had to do the work for those days
